program that tests and can execute a trading algorithm

TODO:
    analyze class
        all indicators
        eval
        pick_trade
    backtest
        output stats
    everywhere
        round all cash values down to two decimal places, int round shares
    analyze
        pick_trades share count
    config
        organize, group into dicts, etc
    train
        batch testing
        more stats
    auto update csv files
        database.update_symbol()
    backtest
        account for splits, dividends


FUTURE:
    auto download an updated csv

        info already in db
    read the news (yahoo rss feeds are ticker based)
        https://developer.yahoo.com/finance/
    add full database functionality
        store all things that happen
    update by ticker name
        download csv, load to db
    q-learning based machine learning algo
        learn weights?
    stock prices --> graph --> pixels --> ml patterns
        conv net for recognition
        pattern dataset generated w/noise --> self labeled
    support / resistance calcuations by gradient boosting methods

    iterate through data once and calculate all indicators

    add fields to analyze object
        predicted price direction
        predicted price after movement
        predicted timeframe
        current price
        shares able to be bought (use to choose between ties, add to eval func)
        
    package the program into executable
