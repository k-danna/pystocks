program that tests and can execute a trading algorithm

TODO:
    api
        print msg in calc_stats for profits
        aapl trade anomolies
            all have -15.9 profit...
    analyze class
        fix macd calculation
            add indicator as positive number when macd says up
            normalize the value between 0 and 1?
            no need to normalize?
    analyze class
        decide on and calc all indicators
        eval algo
        pick_trade algo
    everywhere
        round all cash values down to two decimal places, int round shares
    optimize backtest
        add indicators to db
            query needed ones?
        alternatively query all data, calc all indicators at beginning
            index array to current day on analyze
    analyze
        pick_trades
            share count
    config
        organize, cleanup (into dicts?)
    backtest (train weights)
        batch testing
        more stats
    auto update csv files
        database.update_symbol()
    backtest
        account for splits, dividends


FUTURE:
    auto download an updated csv
        https://github.com/dennislwy/YahooFinanceAPI
        https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44105187/error-in-downloading-csv-from-new-yahoo-finance-historical-data
    ACCOUNT FOR SPLITS / DIVIDENDS
        info already in db
    read the news (yahoo rss feeds are ticker based)
        https://developer.yahoo.com/finance/
    add full database functionality
        store all things that happen
    update by ticker name
        download csv, load to db
    q-learning based machine learning algo
        learn weights?
    stock prices --> graph --> pixels --> ml patterns
        conv net for recognition
        pattern dataset generated w/noise --> self labeled
    support / resistance calcuations by gradient boosting methods

    iterate through data once and calculate all indicators

    add fields to analyze object
        predicted price direction
        predicted price after movement
        predicted timeframe
        current price
        shares able to be bought (use to choose between ties, add to eval func)
        
    package the program into executable
