program that tests and can execute a trading algorithm

TODO:
    auto update csv files
        database.update_symbol()
    backtest
        trade randomly for now
        account for splits, dividends
    analyze class
        all indicators
        implement eval for trading
    backtest
        batch testing
        output stats


FUTURE:
    auto download an updated csv
        https://github.com/dennislwy/YahooFinanceAPI
        https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44105187/error-in-downloading-csv-from-new-yahoo-finance-historical-data
    ACCOUNT FOR SPLITS / DIVIDENDS
        info already in db
    read the news (yahoo rss feeds are ticker based)
        https://developer.yahoo.com/finance/
    add full database functionality
        store all things that happen
    update by ticker name
        download csv, load to db
    q-learning based machine learning algo
        learn weights?
    stock prices --> graph --> pixels --> ml patterns
        conv net for recognition
        pattern dataset generated w/noise --> self labeled
    support / resistance calcuations by gradient boosting methods

    iterate through data once and calculate all indicators

    add fields to analyze object
        predicted price direction
        predicted price after movement
        predicted timeframe
        current price
        shares able to be bought (use to choose between ties, add to eval func)
        
    package the program into executable
